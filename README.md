# Course Material for Integrated Bioinformatics
This repository contains the material for the practical course "Integrated Bioinformatics".

Many biological research questions are centered around trying to understand how small changes in the organisms genome and environment can result in major changes in the cellular and organismal phenotype. Examples for such changes in phenotype can be different body height/weight, pathogenisis, or altered metabolic rates. To gain insights into the mechanism regulating how an organism functions, ideally the full underlying biological system needs to be understood and modeled. To do so, available measurements of the different layers in the central dogma (transcription, translation) and further cellular function (metabolism) have to be integrated.

This course thus deals with one of the central tasks of bioinformatics: integration and unification of biological data from different sources. Specifically, we well work with data sets for genome, transcriptome, proteome and phenome measurements and try to coax out mechanistic insights into the correlation between the genome and downstream processes (altered gene expression and altered metabolism).

Things done in this course:

Data integration using python and pandas
Genotype - Phenotype centered analyses (GWAS and PheWAS) using scipy, statsmodels and PLINK
Differential expression analysis using scipy and statsmodels
Inference of biological networks based on gene expression data
Combination of multiple analysis layers for systems biology-centered data analysis
Data visaulisation in python using matplotlib and bokeh
